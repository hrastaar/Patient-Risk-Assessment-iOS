## How can limited hospital resources help save as many lives as possible? 
An onslaught of COVID-19 afflicted patients at hospitals worldwide is creating nightmare scenarios for medical professionals - understanding which patients are at high risk, those who can go home, and those who immediately need hospital beds is critical for patient success. 
Targeting individuals who are most likely to need help as soon as they get to the hospital is one way to help alleviate this issue. 
To do this, we created an app that allows medical professionals to quickly answer key questions used in four major risk assessment indexes for incoming patients.

These four indexes - SMART-COP, PSI/PORT, MuLBSTA, and SCAP - all offer unique insights into patient mortality risk and likelihood for hospital resources to be needed, like beds and ventilator support. 
And while they overlap significantly in the health data used, there is currently no easy way for all four to be calculated simultaneously. 
Here, weâ€™ve built a way to make that possible - and built a way to use shortened versions of some of the indexes in times of need.

With our app, hospital workers will be able to support their knowledge and identify high risk individuals in a more systematic way. 
With wider adoption and a method for de-identifying patient data and tracking recovery, we will be able to leverage data to continuously refine our classification system and create our own models for patient success.
